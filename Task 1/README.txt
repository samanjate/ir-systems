To run the different models on the given queries in file cacm.query.txt, we first run a python script to convert it into a more readable format. 

The Script.py takes cacm.query.txt as input and then gives cacm.queries.txt file.

The tf-idf, Cosine similarity, LUCENE, and the BM25 models all run on the 
cacm.queries.txt file.
