This folder contains two python scripts.

The tokenizer takes the CACM corpus (http://www.search-engines-book.com/collections/) and tokenizes the html pages and gives the output given in the ‘Tokenized CACM’ folder.

The indexer then takes this tokenized corpus as input and gives ‘inverted_index.txt’ as 
the output.
